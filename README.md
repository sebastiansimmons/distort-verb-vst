# Distort-Verb VST in Rust
A VST plugin written in Rust for distortion+reverb.

Using [this](https://www.seventeencups.net/posts/writing-an-audio-plugin-in-rust/) article by seventeencups, and the documentation for the [vst-rs crate](https://crates.io/crates/vst), I was inspired to make a VST effects plugin.

I am really new to [DSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing) programming so this project is more about getting things working than the final outcome.

## TODO
- [ ] Implement [freeverb](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Freeverb.html) reverb algorithm
